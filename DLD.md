# 🔢 Digital Logic Design

**Digital Logic Design** is the foundation of digital circuits and systems. It involves the use of logic gates, number systems, and Boolean algebra to build circuits and solve problems in digital electronics.

## 🧠 What is Digital Logic?

Digital Logic is the study of digital circuits used in computers and other electronic devices. It focuses on **binary logic**—where data is represented as 1s and 0s. By combining binary signals with logic gates, we create digital systems capable of performing complex tasks.

### 🔌 Logic Gates

Logic gates are the basic building blocks of digital circuits. Each gate represents a fundamental **Boolean operation**:

- **AND Gate (🔲)**: Outputs 1 only when both inputs are 1.
- **OR Gate (🔳)**: Outputs 1 when any input is 1.
- **NOT Gate (➖)**: Outputs the opposite of the input (1 becomes 0, 0 becomes 1).
- **NAND Gate (🅾️)**: Outputs 0 only when both inputs are 1.
- **NOR Gate (🚫)**: Outputs 0 when any input is 1.
- **XOR Gate (✖️)**: Outputs 1 when inputs are different.
- **XNOR Gate (✅)**: Outputs 1 when inputs are the same.

### 📊 Truth Tables

Truth tables are a tool to visualize the output of a gate or circuit for every possible input combination. Here’s an example for an **AND Gate**:

| Input A | Input B | Output (A AND B) |
|---------|---------|------------------|
|    0    |    0    |        0         |
|    0    |    1    |        0         |
|    1    |    0    |        0         |
|    1    |    1    |        1         |

Truth tables help us understand and predict the behavior of digital circuits by covering all input possibilities.

### 🔢 Number Systems

In Digital Logic Design, we primarily use the **Binary** (base-2) system, but other systems are also crucial:

- **Binary (Base-2)**: Uses only 0 and 1. Example: `1010`
- **Decimal (Base-10)**: Our usual counting system. Example: `10`
- **Octal (Base-8)**: Uses digits 0-7. Often used in digital electronics. Example: `12` (Octal) = `10` (Decimal)
- **Hexadecimal (Base-16)**: Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F. Commonly used for memory addressing. Example: `A` in hex = `10` in decimal.

### 🤔 Boolean Algebra

Boolean Algebra is a branch of algebra that deals with binary variables and logical operations. It helps in simplifying complex logic expressions.

Some key laws and properties:

- **Identity Law**: `A + 0 = A` and `A * 1 = A`
- **Null Law**: `A + 1 = 1` and `A * 0 = 0`
- **Complement Law**: `A + A' = 1` and `A * A' = 0`
- **Idempotent Law**: `A + A = A` and `A * A = A`

These laws are used to minimize logic circuits, making them more efficient.
